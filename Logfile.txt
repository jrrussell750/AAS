This project was started in August of 2021.  Its purpose was to provide a flexible interface between an Amazon Echo device and the Aux input on Vintage Stereo equipment.  With this device, the Aux input on manually controlled systems could be automatically switched between Echo and another audio source.  For example, If you were listening to an input from a Volumio server on your Sansui 5000X and you wanted to ask Alexa what time it was, you could say, "Alexa, what time is it," and the Automatic Audio Switch would automatically transfer the Echo audio response to the input.  When Alexa was done giving you the time, the switch would wait approximately 5 seconds and then fall back to the Volumio input.  If you wanted to play a song on your Echo device, the switch would keep it selected until there was at least a 5 second pause.

The original circuit for this project was obtained from Rod Elliott (ESP) of Elliot Sound Products (https://sound-au.com/project38.htm).  For this project, the type of relay was changed from single pole/single throw to double pole/double throw to accomodate both left and right channels, and the value of the resistor controlling the time constant was adjusted to reduce the relay hold time from 10 minutes to 5 seconds.  Three audio jacks (two input and one output) were added.  Audio sampling was restricted to the left channel of the first input jack.  When operating the switch, make sure you plug the echo device into this input.  A circuit diagram and PCB gerber file were produced on www.easyeda.com.  Circuit boards were produced by JLCPCB.
